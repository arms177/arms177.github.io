   <p>My journey started as a certifcation engineer within the Quality Assurance team for a company called Seagate Software. I worked with multiple hardware vendors to integrate product support of their devices with our 
     software. In 2014, I was in a cross roads and decided to take a change in software development. I was fortunate to be able to be part of a tools team where I was able to learn scripting on Windows Powershell, along with 
     the foundations of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, J-Query, and PHP. Soon my role was primarly focused on front end developement, so I started learning the Angular framework. Today, I am in school to receive a MERN certification from MIT to be a fullstack developer. 
     I am exicted to continue growing and expanding my developement skills. </p>
